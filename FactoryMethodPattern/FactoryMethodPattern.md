# Factory Method Pattern

**GoF Definition**:
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.



*Implementation steps* :

    1. First we create the interface that will be implemented by the concrete classes.
    2. Then we create the concrete classes that will implement the interface.
    3. Finally we create the factory class that will create the concrete classes.
